# ip-address-validation-program
This project is a simple IP address validation program that checks if your user input is a valid IP address or not. 
Keep in mind, this project is meant to be for experimental purposes. I don't consider this a real-world application project. 
I code cuz coding is fun.

## Technologies Used: (I used EJS, not sure if I should include HTML here btw.)
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- EJS


## **Here's how you can use these files:**

- Ensure that you have installed Node.js, Express.js, and EJS
- Now that you installed them, use the command: cd 'C:/file/directory...' 
in the terminal to ensure that you are in the right folder
- Use the npm init command to create a json file, and set the type to module in the package.json
- Make sure you have installed the following: npm i express ejs range_check body-parser
- Make sure that your CSS files are inside a folder nested in 'public'
- Your EJS file should be inside the views folder, so that it will work.
- Now you can copy paste the codes here. 
- Feel free to modify the codes, make changes that suits your preferences.

## Conclusion:

I hope you guys find this useful. I'm just an amateur coder I guess, the design is very simple.
But I think it's okay for now. I'm not trying to be a perfectionist, hehe. ðŸ˜„
